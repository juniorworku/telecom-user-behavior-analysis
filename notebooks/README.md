## Task 1: User Overview Analysis

##     Overview

This project focuses on analyzing user behavior and engagement patterns in a telecommunications dataset. The dataset contains various metrics related to user sessions, including session duration, total data usage, application usage, and network performance metrics. The goal of Task 1 is to provide an overview of user behavior and identify key insights to inform business decisions.

##  Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:

-Bearer Id
-Session start and end timestamps
-Session duration (in milliseconds)
-IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)
-MSISDN/Number (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number)
-IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)
L-ocation information
Network performance metrics (e.g., average RTT, average bearer throughput)
-Application usage data (e.g., social media, Google, email, YouTube, gaming)
-Total data usage (DL+UL) in bytes


##  Tasks

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Convert data types as necessary.
Remove duplicate records.
Explore and handle outliers if present.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of numeric and categorical variables.
Conduct bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables.
Visualize key metrics using appropriate plots (e.g., histograms, bar charts, box plots).

3. Basic Metrics Analysis
Calculate basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for numeric variables.
Explore metrics related to network performance and application usage.

4. Non-Graphical Univariate Analysis
Compute dispersion parameters for numeric variables.
Explore the distribution of data using statistical measures.

5. Graphical Univariate Analysis
Visualize data distribution using histograms for numeric variables.
Use bar charts to analyze categorical variables.
Utilize box plots to identify outliers and distribution for numeric variables.

6. Bivariate Analysis
Investigate the relationship between different applications and total data usage using scatter plots or heatmaps.
Interpret findings to identify applications contributing most to total data volume.

7. Value Transformation Analysis
Segment users into decile classes based on total session duration.
Compute total data (DL+UL) per decile class and analyze the distribution.

8. Correlation Analysis
Compute a correlation matrix for key variables (e.g., social media, Google, email, YouTube) to understand relationships.
Interpret findings to identify correlations between different variables.

9. Dimensionality Reduction
Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of the data.
Interpret results to understand the most significant components and their contributions to the variance in the data.

##  Conclusion
The Task 1 analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior and engagement patterns in the telecommunications dataset. By understanding key metrics and relationships between variables, telecom companies can make informed decisions to optimize network performance, enhance user experience, and drive business growth.
